"""STEP 2 — in-process federated orchestrator for Stage 1 (codebook federation).

Implements the true-FL Stage-1 of Method A:

  * client = entity. One Stage1VQVAE per client, materialized once, optimizer
    built once and KEPT ALIVE across rounds (encoder/decoder train locally).
  * the VQ codebook is GLOBAL and frozen during local training
    (`collect_stats_only=True`): each client accumulates raw per-code sufficient
    statistics (n_j, m_j) against the broadcast codebook WITHOUT mutating it.
  * each round: clients upload (n_j, m_j); the server aggregates them
    (Σ n_j, Σ m_j → e_j = M/smoothed(N) = exact pooled k-means M-step,
    Proposition 1), optionally revives globally-dead codes, and broadcasts the
    new codebook back to every client.

No Flower, no subprocesses, no message bus — a single Python process holding a
list of client models. This matches the scale (client=entity, a handful of
silos) and keeps the codebook aggregation (custom, not weight-FedAvg) trivial.

Because the codebook is frozen within a round, the existing commitment loss
(MSE(z, sg(broadcast_code))) already anchors each local encoder to the global
vocabulary — i.e. the FedProto anchor is implicit here; the explicit anchor loss
(STEP 4) only matters once the codebook is allowed to move locally.

CAVEAT — that paragraph describes merge='suffstat' (and 'fedavg'). Under merge='local'
the commitment target is each client's OWN EMA codebook, which chases that client's own
encoder, so the implicit global anchor is GONE: the only cross-client signal left is
whatever `fed_encoder` shares. That is the point of the mode, and also its main risk (the
encoder is free to drift between aggregations).

The ENCODER can be federated on top of that, by one of three algorithms selected with
`enc_fed_algo` — FedAvg (weight-space), FedProx (weight-space + a local proximal anchor)
or FedProto (function-space: no weight averaging, per-code prototypes only). See the
"encoder federation" section below and documentation/FED_ENCODER_ALGOS.md; the arms are
`federated_enc_{fedavg,fedprox,fedproto,commoninit}` in pipeline/federated_eval.py.

    those same round stats. Every existing arm takes this path → byte-identical.

    `ema_decay is not None` ⇒ the `federated_cb_only_ema` regime: the server keeps a

    overwrites `weight[dead]` with `weight[pick] + 0.01·randn`, so with even one dead code
    the returned codebook depends additionally on (i) the global RNG stream at call time and
    (ii) the `dead` mask, i.e. on the fixed integer `threshold`, not on (N, M) alone. Two
    servers given identical (N, M) then disagree. This is a deliberate, data-free repair of
    an unused dictionary entry — nothing client-side leaks into it — but it must not be

# ─── encoder federation (probe: align the TOKENIZER, not just the dictionary) ──
# A shared codebook over divergent local encoders is incoherent — codeword k means
# a different thing per client. Federating the encoder makes the codebook-facing map
# agree, which is also the precondition the suff-stat (Prop.1) merge assumes.
#
# WHICH TENSORS are shared is `fed_encoder` (off | full | partial | neck); HOW they are
# federated is `enc_fed_algo`:
#
#   fedavg   — server averages the shared encoder tensors (data-size weighted) and
#              broadcasts. The textbook baseline (McMahan et al. 2017).
#   fedprox  — identical aggregation, PLUS a local proximal penalty (μ/2)‖w − w^t‖²
#              anchoring each client to the round's broadcast w^t (Li et al. 2020).
#              μ=0 reduces EXACTLY to fedavg.
#   fedproto — NO weight averaging at all (Tan et al. 2022): clients exchange only
#              per-class PROTOTYPES and each client pulls its own representation toward
#              the global prototype of the class it assigned. Here the "classes" are the
#              codebook indices of the frozen broadcast codebook, so the prototype message
#              is exactly the (n_j, m_j) the suff-stat merge already uploads → zero extra
#              communication. The WHOLE encoder is still federated (every encoder parameter
#              receives gradient from the prototype term), but in FUNCTION space, not weight
#              space — which is the axis the matched-fusion evidence says matters.
#
# ── FedProto non-degeneracy (read this before touching the loss) ──────────────
# `SharedVectorQuantizer.anchor_weight` (arm `federated_anchor`) is documented in
# model/vector_quantizer.py as degenerate: its target IS the commitment target, so it
# only rescales `commitment_weight`. The prototype term here avoids that trap twice:
#
#  (a) FORM. Commitment is a PER-SAMPLE pull, mean_i‖z_i − e_{k(i)}‖²; expanding around
#      the per-code batch mean μ_k gives  mean_i‖z_i − μ_{k(i)}‖² + Σ_k (n_k/n)‖μ_k − e_k‖²
#      = WITHIN + BETWEEN. The prototype term is the BETWEEN part alone, so it moves the
#      class centroid without shrinking within-class spread — not a multiple of commitment
#      (its gradient w.r.t. z_i is proportional to (μ_k − p̄_k): the SAME vector for every
#      sample of class k, where commitment gives each sample its own residual).
#  (b) TARGET. With `agg="count"` the aggregate p̄_k = Σ_j m_j^k / Σ_j n_j^k is EXACTLY the
#      Prop.1 merged codebook e_k (up to Laplace smoothing) — same target, different form.
#      With the default `agg="uniform"` (mean over the clients that used code k) the target
#      differs from e_k whenever clients contribute unequal counts, i.e. under exactly the
#      heterogeneity this study is about, and it equalises client influence — the reason
#      FedProto's own aggregation is reported per-class rather than per-sample. Keep
#      `count` available as the paper-faithful ablation and report both.
# Prototypes are necessarily STALE by one round (they summarise the round that just ended),
# which is the same staleness FedProto itself has; round 0 therefore has no term at all.

      "shared"                   federate the running statistics too ("everything the encoder
                                 has"). They are POOLED, not averaged — see `_pool_encoder_bn`.

    `num_batches_tracked` is excluded in every mode: it is an int64 counter, and a float

    are registered buffers. What it does NOT carry — and what makes the difference between
    *continuing* and *restarting with warm weights* — is here:

      * the AdamW moment estimates. This repo deliberately keeps one optimizer alive across
        rounds; dropping its state resets β₁/β₂ and gives every client a transient of ~1/(1−β₁)
        ≈ 10 steps of unpreconditioned updates per resume.
      * the GradScaler scale, so fp16 does not re-search it from 65536.
      * `rounds_done`, without which a cross-round schedule (and the server EMA's cold-start
        bias correction) would restart from t=0.
      * the server-side codebook EMA accumulators, for the `federated_cb_only_ema` regime.
        (They are also recoverable from any client's broadcast EMA buffers, but only up to
        the bias-correction weight `w`, which lives on the server alone.)
      * the LR scheduler's step counter (`enc_sched='cosine'`). `rounds_done` alone does NOT
        restore it: `_attach_cosine_schedules` builds a fresh LambdaLR whose `last_epoch` is
        -1→0, so a continuation would replay the warmup from t=0 and jump the LR back to its
        peak — while this docstring promised the opposite. The lambda closure is not saved
        (LambdaLR.state_dict drops it by design) and does not need to be: the schedule is
        rebuilt from `rounds`/`local_epochs` before the load, and only `last_epoch` /
        `_step_count` come from here. `None` per client when no schedule is attached, which
        is every arm on disk — so this key changes nothing for them.

    format 2 adds `sched`. Both directions stay compatible because the reader takes every

                   AdamW alive per client across rounds, so the proximal gradient
                   μ(w − w^t) is divided by Adam's per-coordinate √v̂ — μ then only
                   ROTATES an update whose magnitude is ≈ lr, and at the start of a round
                   (w = w^t) the pull is exactly zero while the surviving β₁ momentum
                   pushes the client straight back off the aggregate. Faithful, but it can
                   be a no-op at small μ; `last_prox_ratio` is what proves which.
      "decoupled"  the AdamW-consistent analogue: skip the objective and contract after
                   the step, w ← w + lr·μ·(w^t − w). Preconditioner-free, so the drift is
                   multiplied by (1 − lr·μ) per applied step — note the lr: at lr=1e-3
                   even μ=10 removes only 1% of the drift per step. The knob that means
                   "fraction removed per step" is lr·μ, NOT μ (see `last_prox_pull`).

    Either way μ here is NOT numerically comparable to a μ from an SGD FedProx table.

    THE EMPTY-PAIRS GUARD IS DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT THE CONTRACT. It cannot fire from this
    repo: `_local_train_stage1` builds `prox_pairs` once and calls this only under

    The condition worth failing on — μ>0 while the shared set contains no PARAMETER, i.e. a

# The FedProto anchor on the *encoder* (federated_anchor) targets the tokenizer,
# which the suff-stat merge already solves. This lifts the prototype idea to the
# PRIOR: the shared object per round is the ensemble-consensus predictive
# distribution over tokens on a common probe (a function-space prototype), and
# each client's prior is pulled toward it by KL while training on its own data.
# NO weight averaging ever happens — the only thing communicated is the averaged
# predictive distribution (a prototype), exactly the FedProto communication model.
# Deploy = per-client personalized prior (the λ=0 null is `federated_cb_only`).
