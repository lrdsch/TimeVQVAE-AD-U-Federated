=============================================================================
  cf_eval.py — Counterfactual quality evaluation for the trained model.
=============================================================================

Goal: measure whether the counterfactuals produced by stage2.counterfactual()
are valid, sparse, plausible, locally non-degrading, and *faithful* to the
detector's decision (top-k surprise editing must beat random / bottom-k).

Pipeline (single entry point: `main()` / `python pipeline/cf_eval.py`):

  1. Load stage1 + stage2 from the run dir of the active config.
  2. Score the train split with the canonical detect.py pipeline and fit
     the paper-style threshold (per-τ per-(C,F) accumulator).
  3. Walk the test split window-by-window, find the TRUE POSITIVE windows
     (label intersects an anomaly AND the window's ASSEMBLED score — the max
     over the window of detect's overlap-summed per-timestep score — exceeds
     the threshold). Scoring windows in ISOLATION would put them on a ~K×
     smaller scale than the threshold (K ≈ window_length / eval_stride ≈ 10),
     starving the TP set; reusing the assembled per-timestep scores keeps the
     gate on detect's own scale. These are the only windows on which a
     counterfactual is meaningful.
  4. For every TP window, for every q in `cfg.cf_eval.quantiles`, build
     three counterfactuals on the SAME prior:
       - topk_surprise:  the model's own selection (high prior NLL)
       - random:         |M_top| tokens chosen uniformly at random
       - bottomk_surprise: |M_top| tokens with the LOWEST prior NLL
     The three masks have identical sizes — the only thing that changes
     is *which* tokens get rewritten.
  5. For each (window, q, variant), compute the 5 metric blocks:
       (1) validity            — region-level: repair EVERY flagged window of an
                                 anomaly event and check the event drops below
                                 threshold (validity_window = single-window flip,
                                 kept for transparency; see _inject_region_validity)
       (2) sparsity-3-levels   — fraction of tokens / channels / timesteps changed
       (3) plausibility-NLL    — prior NLL of the rewritten tokens
       (4) non-degradation     — Δ-NLL on UNMASKED tokens; MAE on UNCHANGED time/ch
       (5) faithfulness        — Δscore_top vs Δscore_random vs Δscore_bottom

  6. Save per_window.csv (one row per (window, q, variant)) and a small
     report.json with means/stds grouped by (q, variant).

DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) — only computed at q=0 and only if --with_dtw
is passed. At every other q the unmasked-token context anchors the temporal
phase, making DTW numerically equivalent to MAE/RMSE (verified empirically).

This file imports — does NOT duplicate — the scoring primitives from
detect.py (`_combine_scores`, `_resolve_eval_stride`, `_fit_threshold_paper`,
`_score_split`, `_finalize_entities`). The TP gate and CF re-scoring both run on
detect's assembled per-timestep scale (via `_score_split` + `_finalize_entities`)
so they share the TRAIN-fitted threshold's scale. Counterfactual generation goes
through the patched `stage2.counterfactual()` which now accepts an optional
`token_mask` (used here for random / bottom-k).

Output layout (under `artifacts/cf_eval/<run_name>/`):
  per_window.csv   — wide table, one row per (window_id, q, variant)
  report.json      — aggregated stats per (q, variant)
  config.json      — the full cfg used for this evaluation (reproducibility)

# ─── Per-window per-channel scoring (assembled-scale building blocks) ─────────
#
#   detect.py assembles overlapping windows by SUM (no division): each interior
#   timestep's score is the sum of the per-window scores covering it, so the
#   TRAIN-fitted threshold lives on that ~K-fold-summed scale (K ≈ window_length
#   / eval_stride ≈ 10). Scoring a window in ISOLATION (single window, no overlap
#   sum) puts its peak on a ~K× smaller scale, so comparing it against the
#   summed-scale threshold is a scale mismatch — it was starving the TP set
#   (only 9/100 entities produced any TP window even when the detector itself
#   reported recall ≈ 1). We therefore gate TPs and re-score counterfactuals on
#   detect's ASSEMBLED per-timestep score (`entity["overall_scores"]`, reproduced
#   by detect._score_split). The helpers below compute a single window's
#   per-channel CONTRIBUTION so a counterfactual edit can be spliced back into
#   the summed accumulator and re-finalized on the same scale.

    splicing ALL of an event's window deltas removes the full summed contribution
