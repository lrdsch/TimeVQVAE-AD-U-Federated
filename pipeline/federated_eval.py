"""STEP 5 — federated evaluation harness (RQ1: does federation help?).

Trains three arms on the synthetic federated benchmark and compares per-client
detection by REUSING the existing, validated detection pipeline (detect.detect):

  * local-only   — each client trains its full stack (stage1+stage2) ALONE.
  * centralized  — ONE model trained on the POOLED windows of all clients
                   (KEEPING per-entity scaler + per-entity threshold; the only
                   thing centralized is representation learning). The skyline.
  * federated    — Method A: FedProto global codebook + partially-personalized
                   prior (from pipeline/federated.py).

For every (arm, client) we save stage1+stage2 checkpoints and call
`detect.detect(...)`, then aggregate the report metrics MACRO across clients
(mean, std, worst-client). This is the first table of real numbers (RQ1).
