# WHAT IT IS FOR. Every launch of the real sweep costs days. The failures worth catching
# before paying that are not subtle -- an arm that raises, an arm whose json never lands, an
# arm whose `--protocol converged` is not plumbed so `--fed-patience-rounds` is silently
# dead. All three have happened in this repo. This catches all three in minutes.
#
# TVQ_SMOKE=1 collapses the converged-loop budgets (config.apply_env_overrides) so the
# CONVERGED path -- select_on_val, patience, best-on-val restore -- is the one exercised,
# rather than being skipped for speed. The metrics produced are meaningless by construction
# and the run says so on every line of its own output.

# The encoder-federation arms, reported in TEXT rather than as table rows (LAUNCH_RUNBOOK
# §5.2b). fedavg and fedprox are what step 4 of §5.0 launches verbatim, so both must smoke;
# fedprox was added 2026-07-30 when it was promoted out of the cut list (the reason it had
# been cut, "solver no-op", was refuted). fedproto and its null control commoninit joined the
# same day: they complete the trio of §5.2, they are one `--arms` edit away from being
# launched at full budget, and until then NOTHING here had ever executed their code. fedproto
# is the branch with the most code nothing else in this repo touches — per-code prototypes,
# the live assignment mask, the stage-0-only restriction on a Residual-VQ, and the round-0
# seeding of the prototypes from the broadcast codebook — so a crash in any of it surfaced
# only after hours of GPU. commoninit is nearly free and shares the same dispatch branch (it
# IS fedproto with lambda=0 and no averaging), but it takes the OTHER side of every
# `enc_proto_on` gate, which makes it the cheapest cover for that half of the branch.
#
# A smoke case is an arm name optionally followed by `@<variant>`: the variant never reaches
# `--arms`, it only gives a second CONFIGURATION of the same arm its own json, its own log and
# its own arm_extra entry. `ARMS=<name>` from the environment never carries one, so the
# override above is untouched by the convention.

# Per-case extra flags. The smoke must exercise the flags the REAL launch uses, or it green-
# lights a configuration nobody runs. fedprox is the live case: the CLI default is mu=0.01,
# but every measurement and every claim is at the paper value mu=0.1 (form 'loss'), and
# federated.py itself warns below 0.1. Keyed by SMOKE-CASE id, i.e. arm[@variant].
#
# fedproto passes --fedproto-agg EXPLICITLY even though 'uniform' is already the parser
# default, because the two readings run different aggregation code and only one of them is
# the method:
#   uniform  one vote per client. The canonical reading, the parser default, and what the
#            authors' released `proto_aggregation` actually computes (Eq. 6 of Tan et al.
#            2022 is WRITTEN count-weighted; their code is not).
#   count    count-weighted. Degenerate BY CONSTRUCTION and federated.py says so at runtime:
#            the prototype target is the Prop.1 merged codebook to a relative 1e-8, so the arm
#            carries no cross-client information beyond federated_cb_only + common init.
# Both are smoked because at TVQ_SMOKE budgets the second run costs seconds, and 'count' is a
# branch a real sweep would otherwise reach for the first time hours in.
#
# NOT passed here, deliberately: `--fed-enc-cb local`. With enc_fed_algo=fedproto and
# lambda>0, federated.py REFUSES merge != 'suffstat' (federated.py:1426 — with per-client
# dictionaries "code k" denotes a different region on every client, so averaging per-code
# prototypes averages unrelated things). That combination would fail the smoke by
# construction, and it is not what step 4 launches: the default --fed-enc-cb suffstat is.
