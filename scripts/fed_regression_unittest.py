"""Regression guards for the federated launch path. CPU-only, no data, seconds to run:

    /home/leonardo/PhD/TimeVQVAE-AD-M/.venv/bin/python3.10 scripts/fed_regression_unittest.py

Every check here corresponds to a defect that WAS live in this repo on 2026-07-29 and cost
either a wrong number or a wasted sweep. They are cheap to re-break (a new arm, a copied
call site, a "harmless" refactor of the seed schedule) and expensive to notice, so they are
pinned rather than remembered.

  1. FEDAVG MATH. The weighted average is n_k-weighted, all clients end identical, nothing
     outside the shared key set moves, and BN running statistics never enter the linear mean.
  2. SEED SCHEDULE. The old `seed*1000 + round*100 + client` made (seed 7, round 10) and
     (seed 8, round 0) the SAME stream, so multi-seed replicates shared their batch ordering
     and the seed-to-seed variance -- the only thing multi-seed estimates -- was understated.
  3. NO FREE NAMES in federated_stage2. Its truncation alarm referenced `rounds_done`, a
     local of federated_stage1: NameError at the end of training, in exactly the case the
     alarm exists to report.
  4. PROTOCOL PLUMBING. 14 of 19 `train_federated` call sites omitted `protocol=`, so
     `--protocol converged` never reached them: select_on_val off => --fed-patience-rounds
     silently dead => the full 300x10 budget with no stop and no best-on-val restore.
  5. ARM REGISTRY == DISPATCH, and the paper table is exactly what the launcher expands.

Complements scripts/fed_enc_algo_unittest.py (the encoder trio's own semantics).
