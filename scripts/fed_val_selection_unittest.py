"""Regression test for val-based round selection in the federated orchestrator.

`federated_stage1` / `federated_stage2` run every round of the budget (so the
gradient-step count stays identical across arms) and use each client's held-out
`val` only to choose WHICH round's weights to keep. The interesting branch is the
one that fires when the best round is NOT the last — and on a healthy smoke run
the val loss decreases monotonically, so that branch never executes and can rot
silently.

Here the val loss is scripted to dip at round 1 (worse, BEST, worse), forcing the
restore. We then assert the invariants the restore must preserve:

  * stage 1: the returned `global_cb` IS the round-1 codebook, and every client
    holds it (a restore that reloaded client states but left `global_cb` at the
    last round would silently ship a codebook no client has).
  * stage 2: the shared prior body is still identical across clients, and the
    local heads still differ — the full prior state is snapshotted, because a head
    trained to round R paired with a body rolled back to round 1 is a combination
    that never existed during training.
