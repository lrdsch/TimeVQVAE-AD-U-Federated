"""Build toy_fed_uni: the UNIVARIATE federated benchmark (C=1, clustered clients).

Companion to ``build_toy_fed.py`` (fixed C=8). Here every client owns exactly ONE
univariate series, and clients are partitioned into **6 clusters = 6 machine
types**. A cluster is what you federate over: within it the morphology and the
base period are FIXED, so the clients are coherent enough to share a codebook and
a prior body; across clusters they are not.

Why univariate at all
---------------------
At C=8 the encoder is a grouped conv with ``groups=C``, so a federation is only
architecturally possible under a fixed-C regime. At C=1 ``groups=1``: every client
is structurally identical regardless of its domain, and the whole stack (encoder,
decoder, prior) becomes federable — not just the codebook. The cost is that every
channel-attribution metric degenerates (see `metrics_core.channel_localization_at_k`,
which now refuses to score C=1) — that part of the multivariate story is gone.

Cluster design (the non-IID axes)
---------------------------------
  * BETWEEN clusters : waveform morphology + base period. Strong separation.
  * WITHIN a cluster : jitter level, rng realisation, and the per-entity shape
    parameters each waveform samples (duty cycle, ring decay, harmonic weights,
    QRS geometry, …). "Same type of machine, different unit."

Amplitude and offset are deliberately NOT non-IID axes: the pipeline's
per-entity standardiser (``scaling="per_entity_standard"``) removes them.
Keep ``cfg.dataset.window_normalization = "none"`` — a per-window z-score would
erase ``level_shift`` outright, since at C=1 the offset is the only signal.

Anomaly families (all univariate-legitimate; width = base period P, i.e. at least
one latent time-token's receptive field):
    level_shift   - sustained additive offset
    amp_burst     - multiplicative amplitude blow-up around the window mean
    period_break  - the cycle is replaced by an off-period oscillation
``period_break`` is HELD OUT of ~1/3 of clients (unseen-anomaly-family test).

NOTE the C=8 builder used ``corr_break`` as its third family. At C=1 that injector
is a no-op, and it used to return a description string while the writer stamped a
label anyway — a labelled anomaly with zero signal deviation. `_toy_common` now
raises instead of silently no-op'ing, so that class of bug cannot recur.

Outputs (per build_and_write): train/ val/ test/ test_label/ full/ full_label/
test_clean/ test_mask/ events.csv labels.csv metadata.json clusters.json, PLUS:
  * probe/<cluster>.npy — a PUBLIC normal series per cluster (held-out seed, so
    data-independent of every client) for server-side codebook init and the
    cross-client token-agreement diagnostic. Use the cluster probe when you
    federate one cluster.
  * probe/probe.npy     — all cluster probes concatenated; the default global probe.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py --tier dev
    python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py --tier full --train-length 2048
    python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py --print-clusters      # comma lists for --clients
    python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py --wsd-twin            # synthetic twin of wsd_fed (see below)
    python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py --ucr-twin            # lengths sampled from UCR (see below)

The `--wsd-twin` mode builds `toy_fed_uni_wsdlike`: a synthetic dataset with the
SAME setting as the real wsd_fed benchmark — 4 clusters, cluster sizes (5/11/9/6)
and per-client (train, val, test) lengths COPIED verbatim from wsd, val=1440,
metrics_tolerance=14, window=256 (no top-level `period`). Cluster names c0..c3
match wsd, so the same `--clusters c0,c2,c3` driver invocations run on it verbatim.
Only the signal is synthetic — the federation topology and per-client data budget
are identical to wsd, so you can say "same setting, synthetic (controlled) data".

The `--ucr-twin` mode builds `toy_fed_uni_ucrlike`: the standard 6 machine-type
clusters (47 clients in dev), but each client's (train, test) length is SAMPLED
from the UCR Anomaly Archive 2021 (one series drawn per client, paired train:test),
val=1440. Sampled train is capped at `--ucr-cap` (default 32000) — UCR runs to 250k
train steps, untrainable for a federated toy — so series above the cap are dropped
from the pool and sampled tests are clipped to it. Only the signal is synthetic;
the length DISTRIBUTION comes from UCR (a wider/longer regime than wsd).
