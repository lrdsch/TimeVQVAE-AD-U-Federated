  Single-entity-only contract
  ---------------------------
  Training always operates on exactly ONE time series at a time. cfg.dataset.entity_id
  is a single entity id, never "all", never a comma-separated list. The
  scaler is fit on that entity's train segment and applied to its own val
  and test segments (PerEntityScaler with one entity = standard scaler on
  that series). To produce N models for N series, use the unified launcher
  `run.py` — each iteration sets `DATASET_ENTITY` to a different entity and
  runs a full pipeline.

Scoring aggregation: mean, max, topk, sum, median, quantile, trimmed_mean,
winsorized_mean, rms, l2, lp_norm, softmax, logsumexp, mean_max_mix,

    # ⚠️ CORRECTION (2026-08-03). This comment used to claim that 16 "matches upstream
    # TimeVQVAE-AD, which reaches dim=64". That is WRONG, and it propagated into the
    # upstream-ablation design. It confused the top of the encoder BODY with the width
    # of the FINAL projection. Read off upstream's OWN checkpoint
    # (`TimeVQVAE-AnomalyDetection/saved_models/stage1-1.ckpt`, conv weight shapes),
    # their encoder at W=408 is
    #     EncBlock 2->4, 4->8, 8->16, 16->32, then ResBlock 32->64
    # i.e. the body tops out at 32; only the last block reaches 64. Both repos resolve
    # to depth 4 at this window (verified: H'=3, W'=25 on both sides).

    # 4 costs 0.145 AUPRC on ucr_001 (the `width4` ablation cell). But it must not be
