"""c50_table.py — Table IV: the pre-registered confirmation sample, recomputed from disk.

    python scripts/c50_table.py                  # print the table and check it against the paper
    python scripts/c50_table.py --json out.json  # ... and dump the per-series values

The analysis was fixed before any of these numbers existed (docs/PREREGISTRATION.md):

  * PRIMARY endpoint   the archive's own accuracy at tolerance 64 -- one predicted location per
                       series, correct if within 64 timesteps of the labelled anomaly. Read from
                       `paper_top1_acc_at_64` in each client's report.json and averaged over the
                       five clients of the series.
  * SECONDARY          AUPRC of the per-timestep score, read from `summary.<arm>.auprc.mean`.
  * TEST               two-sided sign test across series, ties EXCLUDED from the test and
                       reported separately. Ties are the story here, not a nuisance: the arms
                       agree about whether the single predicted location is found on 31 to 37 of
                       the 48 series, so the effective sample size is 11 to 17, not 48.
  * UNIT               the series. The five clients are shards of one signal, not replicates,
                       so every contrast is paired by series.

The series set is the INTERSECTION of the three arms, which is the pre-registered rule: a series
with an incomplete arm is discarded from all of them. That is what takes 50 down to 48 --
`ucr_190` and `ucr_240` aborted in the federated arm on non-finite entries in the aggregated
codebook.

The mean is printed next to the median because on the primary endpoint the median is zero
wherever ties dominate, which is everywhere.
