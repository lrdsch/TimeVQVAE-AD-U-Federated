# Pre-registration — confirmation sample (50 UCR series)

**Written 2026-08-09, ~03:00 UTC, BEFORE producing any number on the drawn series.**
This is a faithful English rendering of the dated document that was frozen at that time; the
original (Italian) is the one that was written first, and nothing below has been added after the
fact. Two items are marked as later departures.

## The draw (closed, non-renegotiable)

- Population: the **180 series** of the `ucr_split_w2p` build (W = 2 × period).
- Excluded: the **10 development series** (cohort `ucr2p_10`) — 001, 011, 014, 043, 082, 083,
  086, 170, 222, 229.
- Sample: **50 series** drawn with `random.Random(20260809).sample(...)` from the 170 candidates,
  then permuted with the same RNG to fix the **order of execution**.
- The ordered list is at the bottom; the queue executes in that order, so whatever prefix has
  completed by the freeze is a valid random sample by construction.
- **Minimum n: 30 complete series** (all three arms). **Freeze: the morning of 2026-08-18.**
  A series with an incomplete arm at the freeze is discarded entirely, from every arm.

## Arms (identical to the development tags; cohort `c50`, fingerprint 5080389790ba83f3, seed 0)

- `c50_central` — arm `centralized`, extra `--window-normalization zscore`
- `c50_local` — arm `local`, extra `--window-normalization zscore`
- `c50_a2` — arm `federated_enc_fedavg`, extra `--window-normalization zscore --fed-enc-cb
  suffstat --fed-enc-prior partial --fed-enc-bn shared`. The mobile-dictionary variant is
  **excluded**: it failed its development gate on `ucr_043` (0.298 against 0.744).
- Protocol: `converged`, S1 = S2 = 300 rounds (ceiling), patience 6, 10 local epochs, batch 64,
  fp16, metric tolerance 64. Truncated cells are not reportable.
- One post-hoc column at zero cost: **local-fused**, the mean of the five `local` clients'
  z-normalized score profiles. The fusion rule is declared *here*: mean of z-scores; the trimmed
  mean, the median and the rank mean are reported only as sensitivity.

## Analysis (declared now)

- **Primary**: `paper_top1_acc@64` per series; paired comparisons between arms by **sign test**
  across series; **ties count as ties**.
- Secondary: AUPRC (paired Δ, mean + median + win count), AUROC (idem), VUS-PR **per series
  only**, never averaged across series.
- Unit of analysis: the **series** (cluster). The five clients are not replicates.
- Contrasts: A2 vs local · centralized vs local · A2 vs centralized · local-fused vs local and
  vs A2.

## Hardware

All cells on one host (2 × Quadro RTX 8000, sm_75, fp16), so the arms are paired by host and by
architecture.

## What actually happened

- 48 of the 50 series were analyzed. `ucr_190` and `ucr_240` were discarded from **all** arms by
  the rule above: the federated arm aborted on non-finite entries in the aggregated codebook.
  Recovering both as wins would move the primary contrast against local training from p = 0.33 to
  p = 0.17.
- **Departure 1**: `c50_tau64` (the step-counted stage-2 rhythm) was added to the sample after
  this document was written. It is not a pre-registered arm and the paper reports it as a null.
- **Departure 2**: on the primary endpoint the paper also reports a Wilcoxon reading of one
  contrast. The sign test above is the pre-registered test and is the one the conclusion rests
  on; the Wilcoxon is reported as what it is — a test that was not pre-registered.

Series 32 and 33 in that order are the two that were discarded.
