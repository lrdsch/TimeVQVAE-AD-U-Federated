# Reproducing the paper

Three levels, cheapest first:

1. **Check the tables** from the shipped per-cell results — seconds, no GPU, no data.
2. **Check the code** — unit tests plus a smoke run of every arm at collapsed budgets, minutes.
3. **Re-run the campaign** — build the benchmark and launch the cohorts, GPU-weeks.

---

## 1. Check the tables (no GPU, no download)

`artifacts/runs/` ships the per-cell output of every run the paper reports: the per-series summary
json, the per-client `report.json`, and — for the `local` arm on the development set — the
per-timestep score profiles that the fusion analysis consumes. Checkpoints and token caches are
not shipped (54 GB).

```bash
python scripts/paper2_numbers.py                      # Sections VI-A .. VI-E, claim by claim
python scripts/paper2_numbers.py --json /tmp/n.json   # ... and dump the raw values
python scripts/c50_table.py                           # Table IV (confirmation sample, n=48)
python scripts/fusion_probe.py --run artifacts/runs/zn_main --all-series   # configuration (n)
```

`paper2_numbers.py` prints one line per sentence of the paper — `[OK ]` or `[FAIL]`, with the
value it computed next to the value in the text — and exits non-zero if anything disagrees. It
starts with a gate: its own top-1 rule must reproduce the `local` column of Table II to the last
digit, because the fusion rows use that rule on profiles the pipeline never scored as an arm. If
the gate fails, the fusion numbers are declared unvalidated rather than printed as results.

`c50_table.py` recomputes Table IV — win/loss/tie, median, mean and a two-sided sign test with
ties excluded, on both endpoints — and checks it against the published table.

What the shipped results do **not** support: the κ measurement (`latent_probe.py`), the
counterfactual table (`cf_quality.py`) and `fig_overview.py` all read checkpoints, so they need a
run of their own. Their commands are in §4 below.

## 2. Check the code

All of it at once, with a PASS/FAIL line per check and logs under `artifacts/_tests/`:

```bash
bash scripts/run_tests.sh            # layers 1-3: static, unit, shipped results (CPU)
bash scripts/run_tests.sh --smoke    # + layer 4: every arm trained on a GPU
```

The layers separately. First the aggregation math — CPU, seconds each. The last of them trains
two clients for three rounds, so generate the synthetic dataset first (it takes under a second
and needs no download):

```bash
python scripts/build_toy_fed_uni.py            # 47 synthetic series, 6 clusters, generated locally

python scripts/fed_codebook_unittest.py        # Proposition 1: the merged codebook IS the pooled
                                               # k-means M-step, and collecting stats does not
                                               # mutate the codebook
python scripts/fed_regression_unittest.py      # count-weighted FedAvg, the seed schedule, and
                                               # BN running stats never entering the linear mean
python scripts/fed_enc_algo_unittest.py        # FedAvg / FedProx / FedProto, incl. the FedProto
                                               # degeneracy: count-weighted prototypes ARE the
                                               # Prop.1 codebook, uniform ones are not
python scripts/fed_val_selection_unittest.py   # restoring a best round that is not the last one
python scripts/fed_cb_server_ema_unittest.py   # the server-side codebook EMA arm
```

Then one GPU, minutes — every reporting arm trains, saves and scores at collapsed budgets:

```bash
bash scripts/smoke_arms.sh            # toy dataset, 13 cases
bash scripts/smoke_arms.sh --full     # + one real UCR series (needs §3 first)
ARMS=federated_enc_fedavg bash scripts/smoke_arms.sh    # one arm
```

`TVQ_SMOKE=1` collapses the budgets but keeps the *converged* code path — validation selection,
patience, best-round restore — so what is exercised is what runs for real. The metrics a smoke
produces are meaningless and every line of its output says so.

## 3. Build the benchmark

Download the [UCR Time Series Anomaly
Archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/UCR_TimeSeriesAnomalyDatasets2021.zip)
and unzip it so that this exists:

```
preprocessing/dataset/AnomalyDatasets_2021/UCR_TimeSeriesAnomalyDatasets2021/FilesAreInHere/UCR_Anomaly_FullData/
```

Then:

```bash
python scripts/build_ucr_split.py --name ucr_split_w2p --window-mode 2p --shares 10,10,20,20,30 --val-pct 10
python scripts/check_ucr_split.py --root data/raw/ucr_split_w2p   # verify the bytes on disk
```

Each series becomes one federation of five clients holding contiguous, chronological, disjoint
slices of its own training segment (10/10/20/20/30 %), with the last 10 % held out for validation
and the archive's test segment and labels shared and never trained on. The clients are IID by
construction and differ only in how much they hold, which is what removes heterogeneity as the
explanation for any gap between local and federated training.

`--window-mode 2p` sets each series' window to twice its measured period, read from
`preprocessing/UCR_anomaly_dataset_periods.csv`. With that rule 180 of the 250 archive series are
usable: the rest have no measured period, or the smallest client would hold less than one window.
The build asserts the partition property in memory; `check_ucr_split.py` re-asserts it on disk by
reading the source `.txt` back — the shards plus the validation tail must concatenate to the
original training segment exactly.

## 4. Re-run the campaign

A **cohort** pins which series, which window, which tolerance and which seeds a run covers, and
stamps a fingerprint into the manifest of every tag that names it. Two tags with the same
fingerprint are matched by construction. The two cohorts of the paper ship in `cohorts/`:

```bash
python scripts/cohort.py show ucr2p_10        # the 10 development series
python scripts/cohort.py verify c50           # the 50 of the confirmation sample
```

Launch one configuration over one cohort (see [CONFIGURATIONS.md](CONFIGURATIONS.md) for all of
them, or `bash scripts/paper_runs.sh` to print the whole list):

```bash
LAUNCH_GPUS="0 1" SLOTS_PER_GPU=3 bash scripts/launch.sh \
    --cohort ucr2p_10 --tag a2 --arms federated_enc_fedavg \
    --extra "--window-normalization zscore --fed-enc-cb suffstat --fed-enc-prior partial --fed-enc-bn shared"
```

Add `--dry` to see the job list without launching. Runs are resumable: a job whose output json
already exists is skipped, so re-running after an interruption costs only what is missing. Results
land in `artifacts/runs/<tag>/` and logs in `logs/runs/<tag>/`.

The launcher ends with a convergence audit and prints any cell whose best round was its last one.
**Those cells are not reportable**: the model was still improving when the budget ran out, so the
number says something about the budget, not about the method. Raise `--s1-rounds` / `--s2-rounds`
(they are ceilings; patience stops each run where it actually flattens) and re-run.

One cell is one `pipeline/federated_eval.py` invocation and can be run directly:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python pipeline/federated_eval.py \
    --dataset ucr_split_w2p --cluster ucr_011 --arms federated_enc_fedavg \
    --protocol converged --s1-rounds 300 --s2-rounds 300 --local-epochs 10 \
    --fed-patience-rounds 6 --batch 64 --seeds 0 --window-length 182 --metrics-tolerance 64 \
    --window-normalization zscore --fed-enc-cb suffstat --fed-enc-prior partial --fed-enc-bn shared \
    --out-dir artifacts/runs/a2/ckpt/ucr_split_w2p --out-json artifacts/runs/a2/ucr_split_w2p/ucr_011__federated_enc_fedavg.json
```

### The measurements that need a checkpoint tree

Once a tag has run, its checkpoints support the three analyses the shipped results cannot:

```bash
# kappa: do the five clients assign the same code to the same latent position?
python scripts/latent_probe.py --run-dir artifacts/runs/a2 --all-complete \
       --arm federated_enc_fedavg_bn-shared_prior-partial

# counterfactual quality: plausibility and specificity, paired on window and rewritten set
python scripts/cf_quality.py --series ucr_011,ucr_014,ucr_043,ucr_170,ucr_001 \
       --arms A2,local,centralized --out cf_quality.json --dump cf_arrays/

# the counterfactual as the method actually produces it at inference: the mask is whatever the
# client's OWN threshold declares, no label in the loop. This is panel (c) of Fig. 1.
python scripts/cf_explainable.py --tag a2 --series ucr_011 --client 1 --starts 11700 --out cf_ucr_011.npz

# the two figures of the paper
python scripts/fig_framework.py                       # Fig. 1: the arrangement of configuration (g)
python scripts/fig_overview.py --series ucr_011 --tag a2 --cf-npz cf_ucr_011.npz --out fig_overview.pdf
python scripts/cf_figure.py --npz cf_arrays/A2_ucr_043.npz --out fig_counterfactual.pdf  # standalone
```

`fig_overview.py` trains nothing: it reads the built dataset, the `scores.npz` already on disk
under the tag, and a counterfactual dump. It accepts either dump — the label-derived one from
`cf_quality.py` or the label-free one from `cf_explainable.py` — and the published figure uses
the label-free one, as its caption says.

κ is a measured property of the checkpoints, not a label attached to the federated arm: under (g)
it is 1.00 on all ten series (the clients tokenize identically), under (e) the median is 0.07, and
the codebook is bit-identical in both — what separates them is whether the clients *use* it the
same way.

## Protocol notes that change numbers

- **The unit of analysis is the series, not the client.** The five clients are shards of one
  signal with correlated scores; counting them as independent observations inflates *n* tenfold.
  Every comparison is paired by series.
- **The primary endpoint is the archive's own accuracy at tolerance 64** — one predicted location
  per series, hit or miss. It is coarse: on the confirmation sample the arms agree on 31 to 37 of
  48 series, so the effective sample size is 11 to 17, not 48. AUPRC is secondary and reported as
  such. AUROC is not reported (it saturates), and neither are threshold-based or range-aware
  scores (see §V-C of the paper).
- **One seed per cell.** Per-series differences below a few hundredths are not effects.
- **Train to convergence, never to a fixed round budget.** Truncated cells are excluded, not
  reported with a caveat.
